Take_Picture_2
==============
This is application is an attempt to take a picture and save it on the device harddrive. This particular code tries to implement the steps taken on the Xamarain Development Center website that I have been exploring. The particular link to this tutorial is: http://docs.xamarin.com/recipes/android/other_ux/camera_intent/take_a_picture_and_save_using_camera_app/. This code is not as complete as the code in Take_Picture_1.
